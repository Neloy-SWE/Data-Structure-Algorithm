# Data Structure & Algorithm

## Definition of data structure:
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data.

## Type of data structure:
1. **Primiteve data structure:** Can hold a single value. int, char, float, double, poiinter and other primitive data types.
2. **Non-Primiteve data structure:** Divided into two types:
- Linear data structure.
- Non-linear data structure.

### Linear data structure:
Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. Linear structures are divided into two sub-type:
1. **Static data structure:** Static data structure has a fixed memory size. Example: array
2. **Dynamic Data Structure:** In daynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. Example: queue

### Non-Linear data structure:
Data structure where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.


**Array:** (linear data structure)<br>
Type:<br>
1. on the basis of size: fixed size, dynamic size.
2. on the basis of dimensions: 1,2,3.. dimention.


**Linked List:** (linear data structure) consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers or references. each node has has two parts: **data** and **next pointer**.<br>
Note:<br>
1. it mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.
2. linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location.
3. use to implements other data structures like: stack, queue, deque.
4. it is a dynamic data structure.
5. avoids the wastage of memory.
6. we cannot access any elements in a linked list directly.<br>
Type:<br>
1. Singly
2. Doubly
3. Circular
4. Circular doubly
5. Header
