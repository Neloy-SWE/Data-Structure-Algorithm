# Data Structure & Algorithm

## Definition of data structure:
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data.

## Type of data structure:
1. **Primiteve data structure:** Can hold a single value. int, char, float, double, poiinter and other primitive data types.
2. **Non-Primiteve data structure:** Divided into two types:
- Linear data structure.
- Non-linear data structure.

### Linear data structure:
Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. Linear structures are divided into two sub-type:
1. **Static data structure:** Static data structure has a fixed memory size. Example: array
2. **Dynamic Data Structure:** In daynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. Example: queue

### Non-Linear data structure:
Data structure where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.


**Array:** (linear data structure)

Type:<br>
on the basis of size: fixed size, dynamic size.<br>
on the basis of dimensions: 1,2,3.. dimention.
